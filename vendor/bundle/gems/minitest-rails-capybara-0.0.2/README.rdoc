= minitest-rails-capybara

Capybara integration for MiniTest::Rails.

== Install

    gem install minitest-rails-capybara

This installs the following gems:

    minitest
    minitest-rails
    capybara

== Configure

Follow the instructions to configure <tt>minitest-rails</tt>. Then add <tt>minitest-rails-capybara</tt> to the <tt>:test</tt> and <tt>:development</tt> groups in Gemfile:

    group :test, :development do
      gem 'minitest-rails'
      gem 'minitest-rails-capybara'
    end

Add the following to your <tt>minitest_helper.rb</tt> file to the <tt>test</tt> directory.

    require "minitest/rails/capybara"

== Usage

Generate a new acceptance test using the default generator:

    rails generate integration_test CanAccessHome

And you can specify use of the MiniTest::Spec DSL by providing the <tt>--spec</tt> option:

    rails generate integration_test CanAccessHome --spec

You can now use Capybara in your acceptance tests!

    require "minitest_helper"
    
    class CanAccessHomeTest < MiniTest::Rails::ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
      test "the homepage has content" do
        visit root_path
        assert page.has_content?("Home#index")
      end
    end
